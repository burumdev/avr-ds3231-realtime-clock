DS3231 RTC digital clock for AVR atmega328p (Uno)
=========

Rust project for the Arduino Uno that shows time and date on the serial console.
A DS3231 RTC chip (Analog Devices) is connected via i2c to the Uno.

## Libraries used
1. [DS3231-rs](https://github.com/liebman/ds3231-rs) as embedded-hal based DS3231 driver.

2. [avr-hal](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal) as AVR MCU hardware abstraction layer.

## Build Instructions
1. Install prerequisites as described in the [`avr-hal` README] (`avr-gcc`, `avr-libc`, `avrdude`, [`ravedude`]).

2. Run `cargo build` to build the firmware.

3. Run `cargo run` to flash the firmware to a connected board.  If `ravedude`
   fails to detect your board, check its documentation at
   <https://crates.io/crates/ravedude>.

4. `ravedude` will open a console session after flashing where you can interact
   with the UART console of your board.
